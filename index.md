# About Anne Gentle 

Anne is also an industry-recognized author whose books promote collaboration among developers, writers, and other stakeholders within open-source and enterprise communities. Most recently, Anne was a Director for Developer Experience at [Cisco](https://developer.cisco.com) DevNet, working on developer relations, API documentation quality, and tutorials. 

She supports open tools for API design, documentation, and developer support. You can see recordings of her talks on these topics on her [Speaker profile page](https://justwriteclick.com/speaker-profile/).

Anne wrote the book, _Docs Like Code_, to share tested tools and techniques with all who want to provide helpful, accurate technical information to the world.

And if you're going to learn docs-as-code techniques using hands-on tutorials, read [https://docslikecode.com/learn](https://docslikecode.com/learn).

## Portfolio 
While I often lead others in writing projects, here’s a refined project portfolio structure with added context for varying types of writing that I've authored or guided authors to complete.

#### Static Site Generation (SSG) and Templating Evaluations
**Links:** 
- [Evaluating SSG Themes](https://www.docslikecode.com/learn/07-evaluating-ssg-themes/)
- [Evaluating Table Layouts](https://www.docslikecode.com/learn/08-evaluating-table-layouts/)
- [SSG Search Implementations](https://www.docslikecode.com/learn/09-ssg-search-implementations/)
- [Templating](https://www.docslikecode.com/learn/10-templating/)

**Additional Context:** These evaluations are designed for technical writers and developers exploring static site generation (SSG) options. I gathered these questions from various communications with tech writers asking me conceptual questions about SSGs. The guides examine specific features like table layouts, search integrations, and templating capabilities. Each piece assesses practical considerations for maintaining flexible, user-friendly documentation sites using docs-as-code methodologies. 

#### How-to Steps (Procedures)
**Example Project:** 
- [Hands-on with REST APIs](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/devnet-express-security/dne-intro-rest-api/introduction-to-rest-apis/dne-hands-on-rest-apis/hands-on-exercises-with-rest-apis/)

**Additional Context:** 
At Cisco, we provide free online learning through Learning Labs, where we track tutorial completion rates. I developed hands-on labs and procedural guides for Cisco DevNet Learning Labs, including detailed tutorials such as “Hands-on with REST APIs.” These tutorials are aimed at users who need a step-by-step approach to mastering REST APIs in a secure, guided environment. My writing offers clarity and approachability for learners of varying skill levels, ensuring they can confidently achieve each milestone. This course leverages Docker containers to provide a controlled, browser-based environment where users can directly experiment with API requests. The modules serve two primary audiences: security professionals and network engineers, each looking to enhance their programming skills to apply “infrastructure as code” principles. My work here ensures these professionals can transition from traditional networking tasks to programmable automation with Cisco’s security and network platforms. 

#### API Reference Documentation
**Example Projects:**
- [Cisco Catalyst Center API Documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/dna-center/2-3-7/api-quick-start/)
- [OpenStack Object Storage REST API Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/object-store/index.html#)

**Additional Context:** 
I authored foundational templates for API documentation on developer.cisco.com and guided comprehensive API documentation for the Catalyst Center, which involved multiple OpenAPI specifications. Their team assigned sales engineers to write and revise "guides" for API use cases, and I provided guidance and reviews. These references prioritize consistency and usability, helping developers to quickly locate and understand the relevant endpoints, parameters, and data flows. Another example, the OpenStack Object Storage REST API guide, highlights my adaptability across platforms and audiences, ensuring developers can integrate with complex API ecosystems seamlessly.
